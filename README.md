This is the upgraded **Hacker News reading app** that I made sometime earlier (the previous app is also avaliable as a repository at my profile).

I added some new features to it, which include: 
- the ability to bookmark any story or comment, which you can read later - and the new comments are highlighted (the ones you did not see or read earlier); 
- the ability to search through comments, and find the one that you are interested in; 
- the ability to reply to comments (but you must be logged in at original news.ycombinator.com website to do so).

The app is using offical HN API to get the data, and it's client side rendered. 
The technologies used for making this web app are: React (Router, Redux) and vanilla CSS.
